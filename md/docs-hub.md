# Docs Hub

The docs hub builds several independent documentation sets into one site. A dropdown in the sidebar switches between them.

## Setup

Pass one entry per documentation set to `hub()`:

```php
use Docsmith\Docsmith;

Docsmith::make()
    ->output(__DIR__ . '/dist')
    ->title('Acme Docs')
    ->hub([
        'package-a' => ['label' => 'Package A', 'source' => __DIR__ . '/md/a'],
        'package-b' => ['label' => 'Package B', 'source' => __DIR__ . '/md/b'],
    ])
    ->build();
```

## How it works

- Each entry gets one dropdown option and mounts under its slug (`/package-a/...`, `/package-b/...`).
- Nothing is generated at the root. `/` forwards to the first entry.
- Frontmatter `order:` still applies per page.

## Navigation order

Set `navigation` on an entry to control its sidebar order. Entries are matched by title, sidebar label, or file path. Pages not listed keep their natural order after the listed ones:

```php
->hub([
    'package-a' => [
        'label' => 'Package A',
        'source' => __DIR__ . '/md/a',
        'navigation' => ['index.md', 'installation.md', 'usage.md'],
    ],
    'package-b' => ['label' => 'Package B', 'source' => __DIR__ . '/md/b'],
])
```

Entries without `navigation` fall back to the global `navigationOrder([...])`.

### Source-local configuration

A hub source can own its navigation order in a `docs.yml` file at the root of
the source directory. Page entries may omit the `.md` extension, and labeled
sections can contain a `children` list:

```yaml
version: 1

navigation:
  - page: index
    label: Overview
  - installation
  - label: Usage
    children:
      - usage/authentication
      - usage/permissions
```

Use the `page` and `label` form when the sidebar text should differ from the
page heading. This changes only the navigation label; the Markdown heading and
page title are left intact.

Navigation sections start closed, except for the section containing the active
page. Opening or closing a section does not change the state of any other
section.

Explicit `navigation` on the hub entry takes precedence over `docs.yml`, which
in turn takes precedence over the global `navigationOrder([...])` value.

## Hub entries with versions

An entry can embed a `versions` list. The entry stays a single dropdown item, and its pages get version pill buttons:

```php
->hub([
    'auth-jobs' => [
        'label' => 'Auth Jobs',
        'source' => __DIR__ . '/md/auth-jobs',          // backs the default version
        'navigation' => ['index.md', 'usage.md'],       // optional, per entry
        'versions' => [
            ['slug' => 'v2', 'label' => 'v2', 'default' => true],
            ['slug' => 'v1', 'label' => 'v1', 'source' => __DIR__ . '/md/auth-jobs-1x'],
        ],
    ],
])
```

- The `versions` list describes all versions of that entry.
- The primary version (flagged `default`, otherwise the first listed) mounts at the entry root (`/auth-jobs/...`). Siblings nest under it (`/auth-jobs/v1/...`).
- The entry-level `source` can stand in for the primary version's source, as above. Other versions need their own `source`, or they resolve to `{source}/{entry-slug}/{version-slug}` when `source()` is set.

In the built site the dropdown shows only "Auth Jobs", never "Auth Jobs v1", while Auth Jobs pages carry v1/v2 pills.
